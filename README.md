# TunePulse Depricated
## relaunching the project under a different code.

TunePulse V1 was pure HTML, CSS and JS. 
TunePulse V2 was a modern re-launch in Sveltekit, TailwindCSS, TypeScript and Skeleton, but never really took of coding wise. Sveltkit was tough, major upgrades made me re-write the code again and again.
I also learned TailwindCSS, learned Typescript and then needed to handle Skeleton UI V2 upgrade to V3. It was too much.
However, it's a project I don't want to abandone, so here we are TunePulse V3 is getting build as we speak. This time in Vue.JS, TailwindCSS and JS instead of Typescript. Simple and powerfull.
